Excel VBA Export Tool for Version Control Management


##The Issue:
Microsoft Excel files are a popular tool for creating macros and automation code.  However, the code isn't natively exposed in a way that is (easily) digested by most code management systems.

##Solution:
* Extracting the modules that contain the code allows for easy integration into source code management systems.  
* A deskop application that can automate the task with a simple gui interface
